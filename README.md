ðŸ”‘ How to Add API Keys

Since GitHub repos must not contain your keys:

Open Omni in your browser.

Open DevTools Console (F12).

Paste:

localStorage.setItem("openai_key", "sk-your-openai-key");
localStorage.setItem("deepai_key", "your-deepai-key");


Omni will now use OpenAI â†’ if that fails â†’ DeepAI â†’ otherwise YAML.

ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

Upload index.html + memory.yaml to your GitHub repo (omni_local_brain).

Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings â†’ choose main branch.

Omni will be live at:

https://keyhole-creator.github.io/omni_local_brain/


Embed anywhere:

<iframe src="https://keyhole-creator.github.io/omni_local_brain/"
        width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>


âœ… Omni is now a self-contained widget:

YAML foundation (soul).

Agent Zero filter (truth + repair).

API boost (OpenAI â†’ DeepAI).

Widget-ready for Strikingly, NextXus, Federation.

ðŸ‘‰ Roger, want me to also add a Reaction Log (journal) so Omni can record when he used YAML vs OpenAI vs DeepAI â€” like a subconscious diary for you and other AIs in the Federation?
